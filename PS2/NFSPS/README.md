Say goodbye to the streets. In [Need for Speed: ProStreet](https://retroachievements.org/game/2825) you assume the role of Ryan Cooper, a former street racer entering the world of organized track racing. As you climb the ranks of the various racing organizations, you will have to win and dominate the many Race Day events while you earn the right to challenge the Showdown King and the Kings of each individual racing discipline. Defeating all of the Kings earns you the title of Street King.

# 2) Things to Know

- Entering any code will void all achievements, if saved it'll persist forever on that career save file and will transfer over to any other career save you make on that same alias.

- For achievements that require records to be beaten, what's valid is the original record the game starts with and not any records you may have increased. In addition, where specific tracks are required only the normal configuration of the track is valid, not the reverse.

- All 5 bosses have missable achievements related to King Assist as their events are not repeatable: [PH: The Real Showdown King], [PH: The Real Grip King], [PH: The Real Drag King], [PH: The Real Drift King], and [PH: The Real Speed King]. Make sure to select King Assist before challenging them and don't reset the game or choose a different event while doing each boss.

- Keep cars earned from Challenge Race Days with their pre-tuned blueprints intact for later achievements: [PH: When Life Gives You Lemons...], [PH: ...Make Lemonade...], and [PH: ...And Start a Lemonade Stand]. You can modify other blueprints in those cars, but don't change modes or you'll lose the pre-tuned blueprints. If you don't have enough cars with pre-tuned blueprints to enter a Showdown, you'll get locked out of the related achievement as you can only earn Challenge rewards once. As with the boss related achievements, make sure to select King Assist before starting the Race Day and don't reset the game before dominating.
